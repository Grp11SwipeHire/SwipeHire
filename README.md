# SwipeHire

Overview

SwipeHire is a web application that helps college students efficiently find job and internship opportunities tailored to their skills, experiences, and interests. The system allows users to create a short profile, upload their Resume, swipe through job postings drawn from a sample dataset, and automatically rank right-swiped (“liked”) jobs by how well they match the user’s resume information. The app’s main goal is to make the job search process quicker and more engaging for students while providing university career departments with a modern, data-driven tool to support student employability.

Business Need / Why:

College students often struggle to navigate complex job boards or identify roles aligned with their backgrounds. Traditional job portals are time-consuming and lack personalization for early-career candidates. SwipeHire streamlines the discovery process by letting users indicate quick preferences and view clear ‘match percentages’ with no additional cost, improving student engagement and helping universities or career centers integrate smarter matching tools.

How to Run the program:

To run the app, clone the repo to you local device then run the following commands:
cd into the SwipeHire/frontend folder
Run: npm install 
Run: npm run dev
